      <p>This week’s focus was building a website repository for the Digital Fabrication course in order to document my progress and learning curves while navigating through the machines in the Fab Lab. This was my first time approaching coding which was daunting and took a lot of time and patience. Overall, it was extremely rewarding to witness the website come together, from its bones to its soft tissue and eventually to its aesthetics. </p>

      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Getting Started On Github</h2>
      <p>The video instructions on Madison’s course website were very easy to follow. After making an account on Github and downloading the Brackets application, I explored the web templates to find one that would fit for my website.</p>

  </div>
       <p>I downloaded the feature for the easy use progress bar at the bottom of Brackets. I was able to navigate through the Terminal and see where I was on the computer (something very new for me) using “cd” (change directory) and “ls” (list files). </p>

      <p>I created a repository on Github and named it “emilygray” so that  my official website would be emilygray[dot]github[dot]io (I would run into issues with this later).</p>

  </div>
      <p>I cloned the code from the “Band Template” as they had a built in Navigation (Nav) Bar that Madison suggested would be a useful built-in organization tool for this course in particular. I pasted the code into Brackets and activated the Live Preview option and tested it out.</p>
      <p>I committed the changes to my repository, now with a full page of coding ready to be personalized. </p>

      <p>I pushed the changes so that the template under my URL would officially appear. I checked my link immediately after I pushed it and a 404 error page showed up. I checked my Github repository page and found that everything was correctly filed and existed under index.html so I figured it might just take a while for the changes I had pushed to load.</p>

      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Ran into a couple roadblocks...</h2>
      <p>When I tried to get to my website a full 24 hours after I had committed it, the changes still had not loaded and the 404 page came up again. I watched Madison’s instructions again and consulted the TA in the MakerSpace and went to my github repository to see if my link was incorrect. I found that I had not used my username for my website which was why it was not working. At this point I also switched computers from the Mac in the Fiberspace to the Mac in the MakerSpace. Thus, I had to essentially redo everything I had done before under my new and correct website name, emilygray22[dot]github[dot]io.</p>

      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Getting down to business...</h2>
      <p>I started to rename the tabs in the nav bar, beginning with an “About” page. I linked this new file under the website and put “about.html” in my index nav bar where the filler “#” used to be so it would actually lead to my new About page. </p>

    <p> I then started to personalize my about page. I uploaded an image for my home/index page and edited the content so that it would reflect my desired usability. I deleted a couple tabs I did not need from the nav bar and made sure each new tab I added successfully linked from one to another. </p>
    <p> I created my bio for my About page and uploaded a picture to go along with it. The picture was massive when I first uploaded it. I was able to resize it by adjusting the width percent. </p>

    <p> I wanted my weekly project documentation pages to have a specific kind of structure so I went searching on w3schools for templates that fit with my organizational vision. I settled on the basic Web Page Template because it had the text structure and image slots I wanted as well as a sticky sidebar I wanted to try out for a table of contents. I just cloned the section that I needed and pasted it into my Project Management file and combined it with my standard page design and nav bar I had already set up. </p>

      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">More problems and fixes...</h2>
      <p>I had noticed that my pages were not scrolling. I troubleshot this and after much navigation, found that the issue was that my nav bar had extended to my entire page and that my position was “fixed.” I experimented with deleting possible premature or unneeded div’s and found that I needed to add an ending div to my nav bar so that it didn’t extend to the whole page. I committed three times to see if my scrolling worked on each page and finally, it did.</p>

      <p>I was also able to get rid of the shadow beneath my nav bar so that every page was uniform. I did this by finding the settings for the bar and getting rid of the shadow option by putting it at 0%.</p>
    <p> Another issue occurred for me as I was formatting the filler project pages for the next couple projects. I didn’t need to do this but I wanted to be set up with these pages for the next couple of weeks. I had to delete the texts I did not need so that it was very minimal but would not be an unlinked page or show up as a 404 error. </p>

      <p>The first week’s project presented a series of challenges, logistical and technical. I have a Windows laptop, which, from what I understand, is more difficult to build a website on using Bracket's program. I had to transition to a Mac Desktop computer for this project (a computer I am lucky enough to have access to through using either ther Fab Lab or the Fiber Space). Getting used to the Mac set up in it of itself was a process. I have the amazing TA’s and employees (wise technology sages) at the MakerSpace to thank for being patient teachers while helping a novice web designer troubleshoot the headaches of a first website.</p>
        <p> A huge moment for me was getting the images up on the website. Being able to see my art blown up for a website was so gratifying. That was a turning point in my moral for sure. Little formatting problems that, previously I would have run from or just not tried to fix for fear of messing everything up, I was able to work through and fix. This was an incredibly satisfying project. Entry into the technical world to which I had kept myself shunned from for so long, has shown me how artistic creativity is implicit in fields to which I had thought it was foregin. </p>
